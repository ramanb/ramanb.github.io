I am a software developer who has been tech leading teams for about 10 years and who occassionally writes some code.
Bit of a fan of functional programming.
This site is dedicated to software development topics - both technical and around running of teams.

PS - My background is in Control Systems ... the title "Feedforward Loop" is a pun on what we would need to deliver the perfect project.
